"""This lesson is going to introduce the idea of packages through a Gaussian Distribution example.


Include in this Python package will be :

Read in dataset
Calculate mean
Calculate standard deviation
Plot histogram
Plot probability density function
add two gaussian distributions"""




"""Here are a few formulas that might be helpful:

Gaussian Distribution Formulas
probability density function"""

"""Binomial Distribution Formulas
mean"""

"""In other words, a fair coin has a probability of a positive outcome (heads) p = 0.5. If you flip a coin 20 times, the mean would be 20 * 0.5 = 10; you'd expect to get 10 heads.

variance"""

"""Continuing with the coin example, n would be the number of coin tosses and p would be the probability of getting heads.

standard deviation"""

"""or in other words, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance.

probability density function
